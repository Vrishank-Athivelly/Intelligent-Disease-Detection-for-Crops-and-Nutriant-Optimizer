Process of Disease Detection Using Image Processing
The plant disease detection system follows a structured image processing workflow to identify and classify diseases based on leaf images. The key steps involved are:

1. Image Acquisition
Capturing plant leaf images using a camera or drone.
Images are collected in RGB format for further processing.

2. Image Pre-Processing
Noise Removal: Filtering techniques like Gaussian or Median filtering are used to remove unwanted noise.
Contrast Enhancement: Histogram equalization is applied to improve image clarity.
Color Conversion: RGB images are converted into grayscale or HSI (Hue, Saturation, Intensity) format for easier analysis.

3. Image Segmentation
The goal is to separate diseased parts from the healthy region.
Methods used:
K-Means Clustering: Groups similar pixels into clusters to isolate affected areas.
Otsu's Thresholding: Automatically determines the best threshold for segmentation.
Boundary & Spot Detection: Identifies disease-affected spots on the leaf.

4. Feature Extraction
Extracts relevant features such as:
Color: RGB or HSI values help identify disease-specific color changes.
Texture: GLCM (Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix) is used to analyze surface patterns.
Morphology: Shape and structure of the affected regions are assessed.

5. Classification (Disease Identification)
Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) are commonly used classifiers.
Backpropagation Neural Network (BPNN) helps train the model using a dataset of healthy and diseased leaves.
The system compares extracted features with a pre-trained database to identify diseases accurately.

6. Output & Fertilization Recommendation
Once a disease is detected, the system suggests appropriate fertilizers or pesticides based on predefined agricultural data.
IoT integration allows automated spraying of the required treatment.
